# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-Streamlit-App
# Project Purpose:
To demonstrate a full ML project from scratch to deployment to a web app.
# Business Case:
To create a model that accurately predicts calories burnt during any exercise or any workout.
# Goal:
To build an ML model that accurately predicts how much calories are burnt during any workout. This helps individuals to estimate their calories burnt and their food intake.
# Deliverable:
A web app that end users can utilize to calories burnt using an XGBoost model on the backend.

# Accuracy
Accuracy : 0.998806

This model not only predicts the calories burnt, the streamlit app stores the recent data given by the user in csv format and this data will be projected on the dashboard.



# Conclusion:
Predicting calories burned using machine learning can offer valuable insights into individual fitness levels and activity patterns. Our Models can be trained to accurately estimate calorie expenditure based on various inputs such as heart rate, duration, type of activity, and user demographics. However, the effectiveness of these predictions depends on the quality and quantity of data available for training.
Our model can predict the data by using XGBoost we can get better accuracy compared with the other algorithm we will get higher accuracy more than 90%.
